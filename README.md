## KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY ZONATION USING DEEP LEARNING

Usage of Artificial Neural Networks to predict the likelihood of a region to be prone to have landslides or not. Here's an example of the predictive power of the model for Europe:

This Work was carried out together with Faraz Sadeghi Tehrani at Deltares (email: Faraz.Tehrani@deltares.nl). 

You need to follow the instructions in set_environment.docx to create a conda environment to run the codes.

This repository contains:
* Code/: The Python code used to preprocess data and train the deep learning model.

* final_report/: The final report of the project, listing the most important conclussions.

The data to train the model is available upon request.
